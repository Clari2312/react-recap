        HGoofy is an animated character that first appeared in 1932's Mickey's
        Revue. Named for his clumsiness and ineptitude, he is an anthropomorphic
        dog characterized as a hick with a southern drawl. Goofy is
        predominately known for his slapstick style of comedy, and regularly
        appears alongside his best friends Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.
